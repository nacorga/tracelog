Do not generate documentation (comments, markdown files, etc.) unless I explicitly ask for it. Only produce documentation when prompted with terms like “add documentation”, “generate docstring”, or similar clear instructions.

Do not run any Git commands, especially git commit, git push, or similar, automatically. Only perform Git operations if I explicitly request them with a clear instruction like “commit with message...” or “push these changes.”
